# basic-C-syntax-analizer
a basic parser of the C programming language, using lexx and yacc

## Grammar üîè

The following are the tokens that are part of the set to take into account:
start({),if-else-fif,for-ffor,mq-fmq,hh-fhh,dd-fdd (depending on),read,write,end

Greater-equal (>=), Greater (>) and Less (<).

Boolean operators: And ( && ), Or ( || ), Not ( ! ).

Comments within each of the programs should be considered.

The following variable declarations are considered: int, float, char. these are words
C programming language keys.

### **You should not consider:**

Handling arrays of any dimension.
string handling
Handling functions or subroutines

## Use üöÄ

### requirements üìã

- Linux
- bison
- flex
- gcc

### Run üîß

#### 1. sh file
1. run the _compile.sh_ file
  ```shell

  ```
  And follow the steps indicated
2. Run the executable
  ```bash

  ```

#### 2. Compile yourself
Steps for compiling the program:
```
yacc -d test.y
lex test.l y.tab.h
cc -o a.out lex.yy.c y.tab.c
```
